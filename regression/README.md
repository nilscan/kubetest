# Regression Tests

This directory contains example tests which serve as regression tests / examples of tests
which were brought up in issues before. Its purpose is to warehouse the tests which have
previously failed and to ensure that when run now, they pass.

Regression tests are sorted by directory, where the directory name is the number of the
GitHub issue from which the test originated. Tests should be run from within each directory.
